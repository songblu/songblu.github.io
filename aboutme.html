		<textfont style="padding-bottom:10px"> Hello. My name is Elwin Song and I'm a senior in high school. Being born in California was a gift, with silicon valley in the midst of the state, technology was sure to be impactful.
		In 2007, something remarkable happened, the release of the first IPhone. Incredibly something so small could produce equivilent capabilities to a computer. It was mindblowing how something so
		powerful could fit in one's pocket. This is what led my interest in attempting to understand everything. </textfont>
		</section>
		<section>
		<textfont style="padding-bottom:10px">Ever since, my curiosity pondered how the world revolves on a daily basis. My interest in astronomy, physics, and medicine gave me the vision to succeed in school. The overwhelming curiosity to under stand
		fueled my drive to explore the depths of science. Since the era of technology is coming to its peak, understanding computer science has never been sought out for in such high regard. 
		Once I have a basis of coding, I will then be able to learn about the fundamentals of technology. </textfont>
		</section>
		<section>
		<textfont style="padding-bottom:10px">In the future, I seek to create something that will change the world, but the chances of that are fairly low. But, my dedication to learning will not be tarnished by that fact. I will try
		to understand the universe as to the best of my ability and possibly one day have something named after me.
